# Unique Operators
| Operator | Description |
|---|---|
| ! | Add this after something to say that you know it will exist |
| ?? | Nullish Coalescing: use this when you want to preserve data from your input, only when it is null or undefined will it set to the default, rather than when it is just falsy with \|\|, example: `const input = inputFromSomewhere ?? "DEFAULT";` |
