Typescript forces you to be more specific than Javascript.

Typescript is a superset of Javascript, it add some additional functionality, and is compiled back to Javascript. Javascript uses dynamic types, and Typescript uses static types, which basically means types must be declared upon instantiation whereas in Javascript you can change the type of a variable later. Typescript allows us to fix more errors during development where with Javascript some of those issues could only be caught during runtime, this is better for us as a developer.
